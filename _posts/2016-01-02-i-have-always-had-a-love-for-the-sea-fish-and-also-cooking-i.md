I have always had a love for the sea, fish & also cooking. I have also had the idea of opening a fish shop for some time now, but never had the confidence to go about it. However, after receiving my P45 twice in less than months, I became totally disillusioned with the construction industry & felt that the time was right to try something new. So in July 2011, I opened the doors to Fish Seafood Deli, located next to Ryan's Service Station just outside my home town of Rosscarbery, in West Cork. It was with great excitement that we opened a second location, in our neighbouring town of Clonakility in November, 2014\.  The coming years have a lot to offer and my drive to bring fresh fish to your dinner tables continues! I feel that in an ever-increasing health-conscious society that fresh fish is something that people are going to want more & more of. I also believe that West Cork has some of the finest seafood in the country!  And if you don't believe me -- call into our shop & see for yourself!
